Time Complexity: 
The Bubble Sort algorithm loops through every value in the array, comparing it to the value next to it. So for an array of n values, there must be n such comparisons in one loop.

And after one loop, the array is looped through again and again n times.

This means there are nâ‹…n comparisons done in total, so the time complexity for Bubble Sort is:

O(n2)
