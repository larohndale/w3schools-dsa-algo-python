# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

Knowing DSA can help you perform better in job interviews and land great jobs in tech companies.

## DSA History

The word 'algorithm' comes from 'al-Khwarizmi', named after a Persian scholar who lived around year 800.

The concept of algorithmic problem-solving can be traced back to ancient times, long before the invention of computers.

The study of Data Structures and Algorithms really took off with the invention of computers in the 1940s, to efficiently manage and process data.

Today, DSA is a key part of Computer Science education and professional programming, helping us to create faster and more powerful software.

- Python

## DSA Time Complexity

[Read more about DSA Time Complexity from w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_timecomplexity_theory.php)

Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of its input. It provides an estimation of the worst-case scenario for how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. Big O notation is commonly used to represent time complexity. It describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity in terms of the size of its input.

For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), it means that the runtime of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. If the input size doubles, the runtime will approximately double as well.

Understanding time complexity is crucial for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and choosing the most suitable one for a given problem.

# Example: Find the minimum value in an array

```python
#python
my_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]
minVal = my_array[0]


for i in my_array:
if i < minVal:
minVal = i

print('Lowest value:', minVal)
```

The given example demonstrates a basic algorithm for finding the minimum value in an array. It utilizes a simple linear search approach, where it iterates through each element of the array and compares it with the current minimum value. If the current element is smaller than the current minimum value, it updates the minimum value. This algorithm showcases how to efficiently traverse through a collection of data (the array) and identify the smallest element within it.
